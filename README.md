The forum is created using Laravel as a framework and mysql and MySQL Workbench as a database for the web app.

The app is a basic forum app. 
The user can make an account. He can edit this account with changing his profile pic, email, name, password etc.
The user is can view, create/reply to different topics located inside the forums. Those forums have a specific category that makes the search easier. Inside a topic. The user can reply to  already created topic. He can like / dislike a reply from an another user or he can delete his reply if he choses.

The admin can do everything that the user can but he also has access to an admin panel which allows him to create/edit/delete/view categories, forums, ranks, topics or users. 
The admin can change the admin status of an another user/ admin if he choses.
